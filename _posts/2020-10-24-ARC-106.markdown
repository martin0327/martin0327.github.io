[AtCoder Regular Contest 106](https://atcoder.jp/contests/arc106)

Solved only [A](https://atcoder.jp/contests/arc106/submissions/17612491) 
and [B](https://atcoder.jp/contests/arc106/submissions/17622044).

Ranked [1636 out of 4352.](https://atcoder.jp/users/martin0327/history/share/arc106) 

I almost solved [C](https://atcoder.jp/contests/arc106/submissions/17632648). The only edge case I didn't figure out was `n=1, m=0`. 

Here's the revised [solution for C](https://atcoder.jp/contests/arc106/submissions/17642266).
